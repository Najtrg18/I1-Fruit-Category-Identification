# I1-Fruit-category-Identification

# Project
A project of the Data Scientist professional certification with OpenClassRooms

# Data 
Sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits

# Objective 
Implement a fruit category recognition app in a Big Data environment

# Constraints
- All scripts in Pyspark
- Scalable solution - increase in data foreseen
- Use of a cloud environment

# Competencies
- Big data environment 
- Spark apache
- Services cloud AWS : EC2, S3, IAM
- Setting up EC2 : SSH, Python/pip installation, Virtual env, Jupyter installation, Spark installation, and libraries
- Setting up S3 : Bucket S3
- Setting up IAM : security group definition for EC2, setting users for S3
- Big Data libraries : PySpark, Sparl SQL, SparkML, Boto3
- Other libraires : Keras TensorfFlow, Scikit-learn
- Pre-processing, Reduction and Modeling : VGG16, PCA, TSNE, KMeans

# Presentation Feedback from Evaluator
- The learner identified the different architectural building blocks necessary for the implementation of a Big Data environment
- The learner identified the cloud tools to set up the Big Data environment
- Files (starting and post-transformation) are uploaded to cloud storage
- The scripts were executed using machines in the cloud
- One of the scripts allows to write the outputs of the program directly to the cloud storage space
- Critical treatments during a scaling up in terms of data volume are identified
- Scripts are developed in Pyspark
- Bonus: a kmeans is implemented 
- Clear and well-structured presentation
